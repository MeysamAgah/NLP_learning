# NLP_learning
This repository serves as my structured notebook for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Here, you'll find basics, definitions, concepts, and Python code for various NLP algorithms.
<br><br>
**Note**: This repo is primarily designed as a personal reference to help me review NLP concepts over time. While it may not be as polished as a formal tutorial or course, I hope you find it useful! ❤️
