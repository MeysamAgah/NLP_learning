## 2. Damerau–Levenshtein distance
The Damerau–Levenshtein distance is a measure of the similarity between two strings, which takes into account the number of insertion, deletion, substitution, and transposition operations needed to transform one string into the other.
<br><br>
Algorithm: The following procedure outlines the steps to calculate the Damerau–Levenshtein distance between two strings:
<br><br>
Inputs: a(string1) and b(string2)
<br><br>
m = number of characters of a
<br><br>
n = number of characters of b
<br><br>
d = distance_matrix (m+1) x (n+1)
<br><br>
i = number between 0 and m
<br><br>
j = number between 0 and n
